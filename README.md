**ssmTMB** - A fast state-space model for filtering Argos satellite tracking data

This is a minimal package that state-space filters and regularises to a specified time step error-prone Argos satellite tracking data. The fast estimation is acheived by using the Template Model Builder (TMB) package that provides C++ templates.

# All current and future development has been moved to the foieGras repository
